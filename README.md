# Frozen Toast
#### My very first Java Projekt. A Little game with a homemade engine, homemade grafiks and homemade Soundeffects.

After my first year of as a Computer Science Major, my enjoyment of coding was sparked.
This was my attempt at a bigger Projekt.

I went in without any planned architecture and only very basic knowledge of Java.
My only rule was to make everything in this projekt by hand. And except for the backgroundmusic, I did exactly that.

It was never meant to be finished and it very likely never will be. 
Looking back now on what I did, I can't even begin to understand what my thought process was.
But this Projekt did very much serve its purpose. It really showed me the awesome feeling of giving someone else your own creation, that you poured hundreds of hours into and seeing them getting enjoyment out of what you made.

This was an Important Project for me and There still has been no projekt where I have learned more about Programming and Computer Science then this one.
